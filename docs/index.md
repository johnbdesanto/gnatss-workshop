# Community Seafloor Global Navigation Satellite Systems - Acoustic (GNSS-A) Transponder Surveying Software Workshop

## Abstract

This workshop is a short course developed as part of the [Near-trench Community Geodetic Experiment](https://www.seafloorgeodesy.org/commexp), supported by the National Science Foundation, intended to provide an introduction to analyzing Global Navigation Satellite Systems - Acoustic (GNSS-A) data. This workshop will provide a practical introduction to [GNATSS](https://gnatss.readthedocs.io), an open-source software for processing GNSS-A data for seafloor horizontal positioning, including how to install and use the software to process GNSS-A data.

## Learning Goals:
Building strong understanding of GNSS-Acoustics for precise point positioning with a focus on the newly collected data associated with the Community Experiment, including:
* Deployment strategies
* Instrument operations
* Data collection and standards
* Data access
* Processing data using the new GNATSS software

Network with other researchers who share common interests
