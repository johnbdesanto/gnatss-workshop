# GNATSS Workshop
This is a repository of GNATSS processing examples and test data sets. It was developed for a GNSS-A short course in conjunction with the Near-Trench Community Geodesy Experiment, funded by NSF.

Global Navigation Satellite Systems - Acoustic (GNSS-A) is a seafloor geodetic technique that combines acoustic ranging of an array of seafloor transponders with GNSS in order to position points on the seafloor with ~cm level horizontal accuracy.

[GNATSS](https://gnatss.readthedocs.io) is an open-source software for processing GNSS-A data for seafloor horizontal positioning. For more information on how to install and run GNATSS, [click here](https://gnatss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

The [Near-Trench Community Geodetic Experiment](https://www.seafloorgeodesy.org/commexp) is an NSF-funded project tasked with expanding our offshore geodetic coverage of the Cascadia and Alaska subduction zones as well as building the seafloor geodetic user base by making these data freely available and developing tools for their analysis.

<!-- # Running Exercises
The exercises hosted in this repository may be accessed via github Codespaces. In order to access the Codespace, you need to register an account with [github](github.com).

Exercises may be run via Jupyter notebook or on the command line interface. An overview for them is also hosted at [gnatss-workshop.readthedocs.io](https://gnatss-workshop.readthedocs.io).
